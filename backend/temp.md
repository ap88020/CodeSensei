That's a function definition in JavaScript (and many other similar languages). It takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and
returns their sum.

Here are a few ways to represent this function, demonstrating slight variations and common practices:

**1. Standard JavaScript Function Expression:**

```javascript
const add = function(a, b) {
return a + b;
};
```
This is a named function expression, assigning the function to the variable `add`. The `const` keyword indicates that
the variable `add` cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.

**2. Arrow Function (ES6):**

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```
This is a more concise arrow function. For single-expression functions like this, the curly braces `{}` and the `return`
keyword can be omitted.

**3. Function Declaration:**

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```
This is a function declaration. Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are declared
in the code.


All three examples do the same thing: they define a function that adds two numbers and returns the result. The choice
between them often comes down to personal preference and coding style, although arrow functions are generally favored
for their brevity in simple cases. Function declarations are useful when hoisting is desired.
